# Codecademy Computer Science 
`Details of the Computer Science projects and what was learned`

**Important Note:** Portfolio projects will have it's own repository 

## Intro to Programming

### Introduction to the Computer Science Career Path
- Block Letters - [blockletter.py](https://github.com/lev2pr0/codecademy-computerscience-projects/blob/main/blockletter.py)

`Display my initials on screen in block characters to create an ASCII art.`

Learned how to use store rows of strings in variables and display ASCII art initials using loop
<br><br/>
- Receipts for Lovely Loveseats - [LovelyseatsReceipts.py](https://github.com/lev2pr0/codecademy-computerscience-projects/blob/main/LovelyseatsReceipts.py)
  
`Keep receipts for your lovely loveseats. Programming is a treat with this sweet suite of feats! Use strings and numbers to save a catalog of furniture, then perform concatenation and math calculations to create a receipt.`

Learned how to work with multiple variables to perform concatenation and calculations to create a printed receipt. Additionally, this project forced me to organize code and use clear variables for legibility and performance.
