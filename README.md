## Intro to Programming

### Introduction to the Computer Science Career Path
- **Block Letters - [blockletter.py](https://github.com/lev2pr0/codecademy-computerscience-projects/blob/main/blockletter.py)**

`Display my initials on screen in block characters to create an ASCII art.`

Learned how to use store rows of strings in variables and display ASCII art initials using loop
<br><br/>
- **Receipts for Lovely Loveseats - [LovelyseatsReceipts.py](https://github.com/lev2pr0/codecademy-computerscience-projects/blob/main/LovelyseatsReceipts.py)**
  
`Keep receipts for your lovely loveseats. Programming is a treat with this sweet suite of feats! Use strings and numbers to save a catalog of furniture, then perform concatenation and math calculations to create a receipt.`

Learned how to work with multiple variables to perform concatenation and calculations to create a printed receipt. Additionally, this project forced me to organize code and use clear variables for legibility and performance.
<br><br/>
- **Magic 8-Ball - [magic8.py](https://github.com/lev2pr0/codecademy-computerscience-projects/blob/main/magic8.py)**
  
`Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes. We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:`

```python
# List of magic 8 ball answers
magic8_response = ["Yes - definitely",
            "It is decidedly so",
            "Without a doubt",
            "Reply hazy, try again",
            "Ask again later",
            "Better not tell you now",
            "My sources say no",
            "Outlook not so good",
            "Very doubtful"]
```
